# Mobile Responsive Portfolio Page
This is my mobile-responsive website portfolio project. The deployed website can be found at https://koldenblue.github.io/mobile-responsive-portfolio/. The goals were twofold: to create the outline of a portfolio webpage, and to dive into the use of Bootstrap / CSS for mobile-responsive pages. I felt that having an overarching beachy theme really helped the page to come together. Coolers.co was very helpful in choosing the color theme. Thanks goes to Jesus DeLintt for helping to choose a retro-futuristic font for the cover page. Bootstrap was instrumental in designing a mobile-responsive website.

This webpage does have more work to be done before it can truly be called completed. For example, there are no scripting elements, and the contact form does not function. Future work includes improving the pages with more information, such as a detailed resume and links to coding projects. 

Nevertheless, as with many important coding projects, designing the webpage was good practice and a good learning opportunity. And perhaps more importantly, I feel this webpage provides a good baseline that can be built upon for future work.
