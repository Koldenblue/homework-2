# Mobile Responsive Portfolio Page
Welcome to my mobile-responsive website portfolio. The deployed website can be found at https://koldenblue.github.io/kevin-miller-portfolio/. The webpage is designed to be mobile-responsive, and utilizes the Bootstrap CSS library to help achieve this goal. I felt that having an overarching beachy theme really helped the page to come together. Coolers.co was very helpful in choosing the color theme. Thanks goes to Jesus DeLintt for helping to choose a retro-futuristic font for the cover page.

This webpage is being continuously updated. As of this writing, there are no scripting elements. Scripting and other updates are planned, and being added regularly. Future work includes an improved contact form, improved home page, and added scripting elements for interactivity. 

Ultimately this webpage may not be my final portfolio, but it provides an excellent foundation for updates and a framework for showcasing projects.
